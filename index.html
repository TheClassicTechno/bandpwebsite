          <p>The hackathon experience was absolutely wonderful- what I liked most was how beginners friendly the hackathon was. And what I liked best about the hackathon was how it encouraged us to develop solutions on social issues which helped in making me more aware of the issues prevailing in our society and at the same time helped me in honing my [coding] skills.

          <p>I attended the Java workshop- I’m quite familiar with Java, but I just wanted to see how it was being taught. I liked that the instructor kept it simple and engaging. As a mentor, I tried to look out for any questions from the participants. It was nice to see engagement from the participants. Those are the two aspects of the hackathon that I found useful from the participant’s perspective.

          <p>"I found the syntax of JavaScript really helpful as I never saw it before. I also found exploration of JavaScript in real time using VisualCode Studio. I liked the clarification by the workshop host. I found using a common code editor also really helpful to understand that you don’t need a big fancy editor. The workshop was really helpful especially for someone who never had knowledge of JavaScript before.

          <p>My favorite part of the hackathon is coding [my project] and what I liked best about our hackathon is the community involved. My hackathon experience was pretty good as I felt like I had enough time to complete what I wanted. Something valuable I learned from attending HackBytes is learning how a hackathon works.

          <p>I think that the most useful aspect of the workshop was the example websites that were used to help explain certain parts of code. I also think that sharing the slides after the class is over is very useful in helping us to create our own projects outside of the class. I think that this workshop was very helpful and educational. I like the teaching style in which we were shown pieces of code and how they work within a functioning website.
